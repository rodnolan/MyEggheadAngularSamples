	<div ng-app="">
		Root: <input type="text" ng-model="data.message">
		{{data.message}}
		<div ng-controller="FirstCtrlr">
 			One: <input type="text" ng-model="data.message">
 			{{data.message}}
		</div>
		<div ng-controller="SecondCtrlr">
			Two: <input type="text" ng-model="data.message">
			{{data.message}}
		</div>
	</div>

	<p>if the three models are complex expressions (data.message), then they are connected and they stay connected </p>

	<p>if the model is a simple expression (message), the models of <em>one</em> and <em>two</em> seem to be bound to the same model in root only until those elements are filled themselves. Filling <em>one</em> seems to break the bond between it and its parent. Filling <em>two</em> seems to break the bond between it and its parent. So the model in each scope reads from its inherited scope until it's overwritten locally.</p>
