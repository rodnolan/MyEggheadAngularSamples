MyEggheadAngularSamples
=======================

I'm watching the videos on egghead.io and I'm coding as I go... here's that code. 

I'm also using Evernote to take notes to summarize each lesson after I watch the video and experiment with the sample.

I'd like to sync my notes to this github repo too but I haven't had a chance to dig into the API yet. For now: learn angular.
